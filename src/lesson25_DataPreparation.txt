DATA PREPARATION STEP  ->  PURPOSE

- Prepare a balanced dataset, i.e., have as many positive as negative
  examples, or in the case of multi-class problems, roughly the same
  number of cases of each class.
ensure not to dominate some...
X To avoid overfitting / improve generalization
To avoid having your algorithm simply classify everything as belonging to the majority class

- Random Shuffling of the data
To avoid problem due to ordering of the data

- Splitting the data into a training and testing set
prevent overfitting
X To avoid having your algorithm simply classify everything as belonging to the majority class
To avoid overfitting / improve generalization

- Normalization of features, typically to zero mean and unit variance
To avoid individual features or sets of features dominating the response of your classifier
