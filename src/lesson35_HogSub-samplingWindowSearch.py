# Hog Sub-sampling Window Search

Now lets explore a more efficient method for doing the sliding window approach, one that allows us to only have to extract the Hog features once. The code below defines a single function find_cars that's able to both extract features and make predictions.

The find_cars only has to extract hog features once and then can be sub-sampled to get all of its overlaying windows. Each window is defined by a scaling factor where a scale of 1 would result in a window that's 8 x 8 cells then the overlap of each window is in terms of the cell distance. This means that a cells_per_step = 2 would result in a search window overlap of 75%. Its possible to run this same function multiple times for different scale values to generate multiple-scaled search windows.
