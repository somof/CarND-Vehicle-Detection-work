# The Goal of this Project
In this project, 
your goal is to write a software pipeline to identify vehicles in a video 
from a front-facing camera on a car. 
The test images and project video are available in the project repository. 
There is an writeup template in the repostitory provided as a starting point 
for your writeup of the project.

# The Writeup
The writeup you create for this project will be the primary output or product 
you are expected to submit (along with your code of course).

A great writeup should include the rubric points as well as your description 
of how you addressed each point. 
You should include a detailed description of the code used in each step 
(with line-number references and code snippets where necessary), 
and links to other supporting documents or external references. 
You should include images in your writeup to demonstrate how your code works with examples. 
Checkout the writeup template in the project repo as a starting point.

All that said, 
please be concise! We're not looking for you to write a book here, 
just a brief description of how you passed each rubric point, 
and references to the relevant code :).

You can submit your writeup in markdown or use another method and submit a pdf instead.

# Your Code
Your code should be commented well and stand on its own as readable material. 
You should explain, both in the code comments as well as in your writeup, 
how your code works and why you wrote it that way. 
In short, you want to make it easy for a reviewer to understand your code and 
how you used it in your project. 
You are more than welcome to use code from the lesson or elsewhere but if you copy/paste something, 
just make sure to attribute it to the original source and explain how it works and why you are using it.

# What it Takes to Pass
Check out the project rubric for details on what the requirements are for a passing submission. 
Your writeup should include each rubric point and your description of 
how you addressed that point in your submission. 
The project repo provides an example template for your writeup.

There is no starter code provided, 
but you are welcome to use code from the lesson and quizzes as you like. 
You may complete the project in a Jupyter notebook, 
but it's not required. Feel free to build it as a standalone project.

To help the reviewer evaluate your project, 
please save example images from each stage of your pipeline to the output_images folder 
and provide a description of what each image shows in your writeup for the project. 
Please also save your output video and include it with your submission.

# Evaluation
Once you have completed your project, double check the Project Rubric to 
make sure you have addressed all the rubric points. 
Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity reviewer according to that same rubric.

Your project must "meet specifications" in each category in order for your submission to pass. 
If you are happy with your submission, then you are ready to submit! 
If you see room for improvement in any category in which you do not meet specifications, keep working!

# Submission
## What to include in your submission
Include a zipped file with your writeup and all your code (or Jupyter Notebook) and 
example output images and video. 
Alternatively, you may submit a link to your GitHub repo for your project. 
In either case, Remember to include example images for each stage of your pipeline 
and your final output video in your submission.
